# Placeholder for icon-192.png

This file should be replaced with an actual 192x192 PNG icon for PWA.
For now, you can create one using:

- Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Design tools like Figma/Canva
- Or use a simple colored square as placeholder

Colors to use:

- Primary: #93726c (brown/accent)
- Background: #f9f9f9 (light)

Icon should include:

- Letter "A" or full logo
- Minimalist design
- Works well at small sizes
