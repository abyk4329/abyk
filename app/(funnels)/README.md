# Funnel Routes

This route group contains the conversion funnel flow (calculator → interpretations → result → thank-you). Keep funnel-specific layouts, client components, and supporting assets alongside these routes. Shared UI should go through `_components/FunnelPage.tsx` and `layout.tsx` to maintain consistent spacing and metadata.
